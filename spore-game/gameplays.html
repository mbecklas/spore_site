<h2 class="my" id="my_title"> My gameplay </h2>
<p class="my"> I alredy played all the paths pre space stage, and it is really nice to see your creatures evolving. I tryed all the paths and I can afirm that using the carnivorous + violent path in the hard mode it's pretty cool. You need to use stretegies during the tribal stage involving caiting and spliting and conquering. Also in the citie stage you need be be with your eyes opened all the time. 3 minutes without checkin in one nation could mean death. Making friends in the creature part is also pretty fun, because they will join your group when you became a bit smarter, ad you can call some beffy boys to help you solve old issues. </p>

<h2 class="why" id="why_title"> Why is this game so special to me?</h2>
<p class="why"> Before starting to talking about why this universe of this game is so beutifull I would like to mention how I discovered this game and my whole history with it. I saw a series on youtube in 2016(this game is from 2008), I imediatly fell in love with the game and bought it on steam and them started my adventure. I talked with a friend at school that also played the game and he adiviced me to start as a herbivorous because it was esier, so as soon as I arrived home I opened the game and started my 6 year long saga. I started my first creature, called:"Fransino", and after a lot of effort, trial and error the Fransinos reached space. After that point I started griding for money, and afther two weeks I started playing a new game, because I was tierd of the same griding. Arround one year later I decided to play Spore again, but with a new civilization. The brutals and merceless: "Azul59x" this guys never made a peace deal trought their hole existence, and when I reached the space stage I made one alience and started bombing and nuking everyone arround me. I wasn't interested in reaching the center of the galaxy with them,
     I just wanted to creat a giant empire. After one month of pillaging in desiming entire planets and ecosystems I got bored and started playing other things. And again, after 1 year I decided to play a bit more with Azul59x and then start 3 new civilizations, each one following a different path. I would stop when I reached the space stage. This was pretty cool and after concluding it I took a break from spore. 2 years later in 2020 the pandemic came, and I had a lot of free time, so I decided to try spore again. I started doing speed runs until the space stage and arround 2020 and 2021 I met Marcão, he is 1 year older then me in school, so we talked more online. We started competing against each other in spore speed runs, and he won almost everysngle one of them, but in the hollidays we did a ton of remaches and we ended up in a balance between win and loses. After ending my Saga with Marcão I decided to end my dream from 10 year's old me. And after a lot of grinding I could reach the center of the galaxy, end the game, terramform a lot of planets to increase the level of my colonies and reduce by half the size of the strongest empire of the game.
      It was really cool to see myself from 5/6 years ago and myself from the present could build something together and apreciate how far we got. Spore is not just a game, it is a galaxy, and a lot of it was hand made by the developers, more then 10 thousen stars and planets you can visit, different ecosistems, a vast amount of places to explore. When you are playing Spore you are only limited by your own creative and how much you want to play the game. Now a days, when I open Spore I see a time capsule, When I see my old empires I remember what I used to do in each year of those empires creation and how my surroundings were like. I love Spore, and despite being a faliure in the view of moderm critics that don't want to bring a game to it limits and are terrified by the ugly graphics I still love what this game made me built and expirience. All the good moments that it brought me and the good moments that it still brings to me. If you want to have an amazing experience with games, stop juging them by how much money was invested in the project, or how good are the graphics. Start enjoying a game by what you built with it and how it changed you. Try playing old games and try not following the path they want you to follow, that's all I had to say. Goodbye.
